* Create the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`using Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns)
* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.
